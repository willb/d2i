This is a source-to-image builder that takes a git repository of
data files and generates a single-node Minio service to serve them
over S3.  It is intended for self-contained data processing demos
and tutorials that require a flexible and straightforward way to
deploy canned example data.  It is not intended for production use.

To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

The source repository should be a directory of directories, each of
which will be published as a bucket.  To access the Minio service,
run the resulting image and hit port 9000 on the container.  By default,
the access key will be "username" and the secret key will be "password",
but you can override these values by specifying MINIO_ACCESS_KEY and
MINIO_SECRET_KEY environment variables.
